  # The tests are done with firefox because chrome is
  # often added as a stable prefix in third-party linux
  # distributions and firefox is almost always in the default distribution repositories.
  #
  # Build_runner calls google-chrome, but with the prefix.
  # it turns out google-chrome-stable, which makes build_runner unable to run the tests.
  #
  # The best solution at the moment, is to change the platform from chrome to firefox.
